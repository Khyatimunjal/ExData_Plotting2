## Question 4
## Across the U.S, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999-2008 ?

## The Answer: From 2005 to 2008, there is a significat rapid decrease in coal combustion-related sources. 
## Comparing with the number of PM2.5 emission from coal combustion-related in 1999, almost decrease 275000 emissions.
